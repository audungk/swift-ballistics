# swift-ballistics
LGPL library for small arms ballistic calculations written in Swift

The library is a port of the go version located at https://github.com/gehtsoft-usa/go_ballisticcalc

The current status of the project is ALPHA version.

RISK NOTICE

The library performs very limited simulation of a complex physical process and so it performs a lot of approximations. Therefore the calculation results MUST NOT be considered as completely and reliably reflecting actual behavior or characteristics of projectiles. While these results may be used for educational purpose, they must NOT be considered as reliable for the areas where incorrect calculation may cause making a wrong decision, financial harm, or can put a human life at risk.
